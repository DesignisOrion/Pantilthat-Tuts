# Pantilthat Controls for Raspberry Pi 4

In this project I wanted to dive a bit deeper within the Rapsberry Pi 4 device. Created a simple controller allowing the pantilthat operate in the directions of UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT.

## Usage

```python
pip install pantilthat
```

```python
import pantilthat
import time
```
